Motivation icons for Photoshop & Illustrator
============================================

Into
----
When I saw the [Logic Pro X](http://www.apple.com/ru/logic-pro/) icon I thought that the apps for creative work should have similar ones, 
because it's a beautiful example of an icon that motivates you. Without thinking twice I made two icons for Adobe Photoshop 
and Adobe Illustrator as these are the apps which I use in my everyday work. For the Photoshop Iâ€™ve chosen "Mona Lisa" by Leonardo 
and for the Illustrator "Hope" by Shepard Perry.
